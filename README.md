# MoviesWiki
A simple movies search web app with a login page that redirects to the app. This is created using HTML,CSS and JavaScript.
Running the login-page.html file in default browser.
It opens the Registration page, where you are asked to enter the username and password. If the entered password is wrong it prompts a alert message saying the password or the username entered is wrong. But if they are correct it redirects you to MoviesWiki site wherein you see the search bar where you can type the keywords from the movie name. When you press enter then it shows the various movies with that word in its name. You can open any one of them to see the details about the movie and also get a link for its imdb site.
